# Loan Qualifier

The purpose of this application is to determine if an applicant qualifies for a list of loans based on the applicant input in the command line interface. If the applicant doesn't qualify for a loan, the application will say so. The application will ask the user if they want to save a list of qualifying loans in a .csv file.
